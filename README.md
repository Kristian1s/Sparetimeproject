# Sparetimeproject

This project is currently not finished. 
Its running with my local database from mySql, so it won't run for others.

Before i finish more of it, and start hosting it, it's just a code-showcase of a little sideproject i got going.

Endpoints are not secure at the moment, only hidden for unauthenticated  users.
# Technologies used
1. Nodejs with Express
2. mySql with sequelize as ORM
3. Embedded javascript (ejs) for rendering data to browser.
4. Auth0 oidc for user authentication
5. swagger for documentation creatiion.
